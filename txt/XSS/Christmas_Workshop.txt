Christmas Workshop
==================

How does this work??
--------------------

``` {.html}
<a href="https://google.com" target="_blank">Click here for a surprise!</a>
```

Explanation: This URL contains a link that redirects the user to Google
when clicked. This can be used to trick users into visiting malicious
websites or performing unintended actions.

Can also remove the target=\"\_blank\" to prevent the new tab from
opening.

``` {.html}
<a href = "https://google.com">Click here for a surprise!</a>
```
